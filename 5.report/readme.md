# INTRODUCTION #
This Mini Project in C Snake Game is a simple console application without graphics. In this project, you can play the popular “Snake Game” just like you played it elsewhere. You have to use the up, down, right or left arrows to move the snake. Foods are provided at the several co-ordinates of the screen for the snake to eat. Every time the snake eats the food, its length will by increased by one element along with the score. The source code for Snake Game in C is complete and totally error-free. It is compiled in Code::blocks using the gcc compiler. The code is about 550 lines; so I haven’t displayed the source code here. You can directly download the source code plus application file from the link below.
